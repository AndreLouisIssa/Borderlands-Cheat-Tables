# Borderlands-Cheat-Tables
A repository for cheat table compilations for Borderlands titles.   
*Note: These are NOT plugins for BLCMM these are Cheat Engine Cheat Tables and thus are Windows (or WYNE) exclusive*

Downloads for Cheat Engine can be found [Here](http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)     
A download without installer is available for [Cheat Engine 6.6](http://www.cheatengine.org/download/CheatEngine66_NOsetup.rar)
EDIT: Must go here https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/releases/download/6.6/CheatEngine66.exe

Usage:
- You can choose to start the game first or after opening the table   
- Open the tables (.CT files) using Cheat Engine (at least version 6.4?)       

Once both table is open and the game is running...

**UnlockConsole.CT**:   
1. Click the monitor icon in the top left, select the game process.   
1. Enable the scripts you want by clicking the checkboxes at the bottom    

**BL2.CT** or **TPS.CT** (TechnoJacker's Cheat Table Compilation):
1. Click the checkbox next to `[Enable]`
1. Wait a bit and then enable the scripts you want throughout the different subsections    
(You may want to enter an instance (load a save) for some of them to work.)
